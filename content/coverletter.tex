%-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
\begin{cvletter}
    as part of the event series \textit{"Digital Week"} I got an insight into your company structures,
    which I remembered favorably.
    The agile and target-oriented way of working,
    paired with ambitious and realistic goals,
    appeals to me very much.
    I would like to grow together with the company by solving the challenges that everyday business presents
    and explore new boundaries.

    I completed my master's degree in physics at the Technical University of Dortmund.
    The main topics of my studies were \textit{``Machine Learning''} and \textit{``Computational Physics''}.
    At the chair of Astroparticle Physics, I worked on the development of Monte Carlo simulations of leptonic interactions in particle showers.
    Thereby I learned the collaborative work on larger software projects and strengthened the confident handling of \textit{C++} and \textit{Python}.
    Based on these simulations, statistical big data analyses are performed for measurement experiments,
    at which I was capable to actively participate in the development.

    % First experience to share my knowledge with other interested people I could gain by creating and holding the tutorial of the course \textit{``Statistical Methods of Data Analysis''}.
    By creating and holding the excersises of the course \textit{``Statistical Methods of Data Analysis''}, as well as on larger regular conferences,
    I could gain first experiences to share my knowledge with other people.
    In my leisure, I pursue performance-oriented judo, which is about disciplined and fair competition, both as a team and alone.
    Working on smaller programming projects with friends gives me a lot of
    pleasure, where the aim is to find a practical solution with a team in
    limited time. % mit eigeninitative

    With a commitment and an interest in the implementation of
    theoretical models in application-related processes, I would like to join
    your team.
    I am looking forward to convince you in a personal conversation.
