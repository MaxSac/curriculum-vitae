\begin{cvletter}
    as part of the event series \textit{"Digital Week"}, I got an insight into your company structure,
    which I remembered favourably.
    The agile and target-oriented way of working,
    paired with ambitious and realistic goals,
    appeals to me a lot.
    I would like to grow alongside the company by analysing the company's data
    and finding the optimal decision based on it, to reduce risks and optimize gains.
    Offering consumers more likely to be liked and fit clothing based on machine learning optimized decision-making sounds both ecologically and economically to me.
    Therefore I would be delighted to assist in this regard.

    I completed the master's degree in physics at the Technical University of Dortmund.
    Main aspects during my studies were \textit{``Machine Learning''} and \textit{``Computational Physics''}.
    At the chair of astroparticle physics, I worked on the development of Monte Carlo simulations of leptonic interactions in particle showers.
    Thereby I learned the collaborative work on larger software projects and strengthened the confident handling of \textit{C++} and \textit{Python}.
    Based on these simulations, statistical big data analyses are performed for measurement experiments,
    where I was capable to actively participate in the development.

    By creating and holding the exercises in the course
    \textit{``Statistical Methods of Data Analysis''}, as well as
    presentations at larger regular conferences,
    I gained first experiences to share my knowledge with other people.
    In my leisure, I pursue performance-oriented judo, which is about disciplined and fair competition, both as a team and alone.
    Working on smaller programming projects, where the aim is to find a
    practical solution in a team of friends in limited time, gives me a lot of
    pleasure.

    With a commitment and an interest in the implementation of
    theoretical models in application-related processes, I would like to join
    your team.
    I am looking forward to convincing you in a personal conversation.
